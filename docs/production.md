# Production Deployment Guide

Follow the steps below to deploy the Save My Notes Application to a production environment.

## Prerequisites
- Server with a supported operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 18.04)
- Web server (e.g., Nginx)
- Application server (e.g., Gunicorn)
- PostgreSQL database server

## Deployment Steps
1. Clone the repository on your server:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abdurrahaman8035/save_my_notes.git
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Set up the production environment variables:
   - Create a .env file in the project's root directory
   - Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, secret key, etc.)
   ```
   DEBUG=False
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   ```
6. Collect static files:
   ```
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```
7. Set up the web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve static and media files
   - Configure the server to forward requests to the application server (e.g., Gunicorn)
8. Set up the application server (e.g., Gunicorn) to run the Django application
9. Set up the database server (e.g., PostgreSQL) and update the database configuration in settings.py
10. Restart the web server and application server
11. Access the application using your server's domain name or IP address

## Maintenance
- Set up regular backups of the production database
- Monitor server logs for any errors or issues
- Keep the system and dependencies up to date with security patches and updates
